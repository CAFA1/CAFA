ImageMagick for Debian

----------------------

  When you submit a bug report, please include a reference to the image which
  exposed the bug. Either attach it, or put it up on a web page somewhere and
  give the URL.


  The default number of bits in a pixel quantum is 16. If you have a problem
  with the depth of the image, you can set the '-depth 8' command-line option.
