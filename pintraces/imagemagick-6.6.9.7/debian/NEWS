imagemagick (8:6.6.9.7-3) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Please note that imagemagick version 6.6.9.7 has moved its global 
  configuration files from /usr/share/imagemagick to /etc/ImageMagick, 
  following the FHS. See the package imagemagick-doc or 
  http://www.imagemagick.org/script/resources.php for more information 
  on configuring ImageMagick.
  .
  This will lose any changes you may have made to these files, 
  in the extremely unlikely case that you have customized them (doing so 
  was not officially supported by either upstream or Debian versions 
  before 6.6.9).

imagemagick (7:6.5.5.3-1exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  The SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz coders have been moved to a new
  package, libmagickcore3-extra. In order to use some of these coders with
  Imagemagick you will need to install it (if recommended packages aren't
  installed by default in your system).
