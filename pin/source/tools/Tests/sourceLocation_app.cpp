/*
 * This app checks a bug in the debug_elf cache mechanism. The cache contains images
 * that have previously been searched for debug information. When a pintool calls the
 * PIN_GetSourceLocation API, this cache is searched first (for the nearest address
 * which is greater or equal to the one being searched for). However, unloaded images
 * were never removed from the cache. When the API was used during an image unload
 * callback, if the images at high addresses were removed first, the search could be
 * conducted on images in the cache that had already been removed from Pin's internal
 * data structures, thus causing an assertion. The solution was to remove these images
 * from the cache as well as from the other data structres.
 * This app loads two images and then unloads the higher addressed one first in order
 * to recreate the conditions mentioned above.
