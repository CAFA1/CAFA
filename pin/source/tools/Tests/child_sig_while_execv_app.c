/*

This test creates the scenario in which prcocess that runs under Pin that fail in execv syscall.
The process in this case calls waitpid to wait for its injector to exit, in this point the process
receives a siganl and exit from the waitpid syscall with errno==EINTR.

To generate this scenario the application creates 10 child processes that sends many SIGCHLD to parent process.
The parent process use execvp to run simple application located in ./obj-intel64 .
The execvp tries to run the simple application by activating execv on each directory in system PATH.
This is causing many failures in execv syscall activation.

The scenario of many SIGCHLD signals along with many failures in execv bring us to the requested case.
