/*
 * This program tests for a bug with waitpid. We run pin in a child and
 * wait for it. If pin uses ptrace attach to inject itself, the waitpid
 * fails with ECHILD. This appears to be a bug in waitpid that is fixed in
 * 2.6 kernels. Pin works around the problem by not using attach to inject
 * itself on 2.4 systems. This test checks the above mentioned workaround.
 * The criteria for success are that waitpid does not fail, i.e. returns
 * with the pid of the child, and that the child ran Pin succesfully.
