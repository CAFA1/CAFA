/*
 * This application creates 6 threads including the main thread. We check 5 different exit scenarios (depending on the
 * parameter passed to the application) and expect all threadFini callbacks to be given. During the test, some threads
 * wait (busy-wait or sleep), while others exit without terminating the application.
 *
 * The exit scenarios are as follows:
 * 0. Tool calls PIN_ExitApplication on an application thread.
 * 1. Tool calls PIN_ExitApplication on an internal thread.
 * 2. Secondary thread calls exit().
 * 3. Main thread calls exit().
 * 4. Main thread exits normally with "return".
