/*! @brief  Helper object for exponential delays.
 *
 * A helper object that implements an exponential backoff algorithm.  This is most often
 * used inside a compare-swap loop to prevent thrashing when there is high contention.
 *
 *  @param STATS    Type of an object that collects statistics.  See NULLSTATS for a model.
 *
 * @par Example:
 *                                                                                          \code
