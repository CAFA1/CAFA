/*! @brief  Unordered set of data with pre-allocated elements.
 *
 * A set container that is thread safe and safe to use from signal handlers.
 * It uses compare-and-swap operations to maintain atomicity rather than locking.
 * This ensures that operations are safe even if a signal interrupts an
 * operation and the signal handler accesses the same set.  The set also
 * statically allocates all of its data, so operations on the set will never
 * attempt to dynamically allocate memory.
 *
 *  @param KEY          The type of the data element contained in the set.  The
 *                       OPS operations (Load, Store, CompareAndSwap) must
 *                       be supported for this data type.
 *  @param InvalidKey1  The client must provide two "invalid" key values, which it
 *                       promises to never use when inserting into the set.
 *  @param InvalidKey2  The second "invalid" key value.
 *  @param Capacity     Maximum number of elements that the set can hold.
 *  @param STATS        Type of an object that collects statistics.  See NULLSTATS for a model.
 *
 * @par Example:
 *                                                                                          \code
