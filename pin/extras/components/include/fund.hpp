/*!
 * The FUND namespace provides a small set of fundamental types that are used
 * by many other components.
 *
 * The compiler may pre-define the following macro values on the command
 * line in order to define the "host" and "target" system.  The "host" system
 * is the system where the code will run.
 *
 * The "target" system is more nebulous and only makes sense for certain
 * applications.  For example, if the application is a compiler, "target"
 * may tell the type of code that the compiler generates code for.  If the
 * application is a cross-compiler, "host" and "target" will be different.
 *
 * These are the macros that the compiler may pre-define:
 *
 *  - FUND_TC_HOSTCPU       One of the values FUND_CPU_IA32, FUND_CPU_INTEL64,
 *                           FUND_CPU_IA64, or FUND_CPU_MIC.
 *  - FUND_TC_HOSTOS        One of the values FUND_OS_LINUX, FUND_OS_WINDOWS,
 *                           FUND_OS_MAC, or FUND_OS_BSD.
 *  - FUND_TC_TARGETCPU     Either FUND_CPU_NONE or one of the other FUND_CPU_
 *                           values listed above.  The value FUND_CPU_NONE
 *                           indicates that there is no concept of "target"
 *                           for this compilation.
 *  - FUND_TC_TARGETOS      Either FUND_OS_NONE or one of the other FUND_OS_
 *                           values listed above.  The value FUND_OS_NONE
 *                           indicates that there is no concept of "target"
 *                           for this compilation.
 *
 * For example, these compiler pre-defines specify code that will be compiled
 * to run on IA32 / Linux.  There is no concept of "target" system.
 *
 *                                                                      \code
 *  -DFUND_TC_HOSTCPU=FUND_CPU_IA32
 *  -DFUND_TC_HOSTOS=FUND_OS_LINUX
 *  -DFUND_TC_TARGETCPU=FUND_CPU_NONE
 *  -DFUND_TC_TARGETOS=FUND_OS_NONE
 *                                                                      \endcode
