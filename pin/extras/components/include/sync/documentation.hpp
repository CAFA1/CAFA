/*! \page SYNC_POD Normal, POD, and SAFEPOD Class Types
 *
 * Each synchronization model has several possible implementation types.  For
 * example, SIMPLE_LOCK is an abstract model for a simple mutex lock.  There
 * are concrete implementations of this model named SIMPLE_LOCK_SPIN,
 * SIMPLE_LOCK_SAFEPOD_SPIN, SIMPLE_LOCK_FUTEX, etc.  Furthermore, there are
 * three categories of possible concrete implementations: normal, POD, and,
 * SAFEPOD.  The category can be inferred from the name of each concrete
 * implementation type (e.g. SIMPLE_LOCK_SAFEPOD_SPIN has category SAFEPOD).
 *
 * Normal types are normal C++ types, which have constructors and destructors.
 * Often the constructor will fully initialize the object, though some types
 * also have an Initialize() method that must also be called.  In general, it
 * is only necessary to call the Initialize() method if the type could return
 * an error during initialization.  It is never necessary to call the Destroy()
 * method because the destructor will always fully destroy the object.
 * However, "normal" types still provide a dummy Destroy() method so that they
 * have the same model as the POD and SAFEPOD types.
 *
 * All "normal" concrete types derive from their associated model base class.
 * For example, SIMPLE_LOCK_SPIN derives from SIMPLE_LOCK.  This allows you to
 * use a pointer to the base class as a generic pointer to any concrete
 * implementation.
 *
 * POD types are "plain old data", a term defined by the C++ language.  These
 * types do not have constructors or destructors, so they must be initialized
 * by calling their Initialize() method and they must be destroyed by calling
 * their Destroy() method.  POD types do not derive from the model base class
 * because POD types (as defined by the C++ language) cannot have base classes.
 *
 * SAFEPOD types are a special case of POD types.  When a SAFEPOD type is
 * initialized to binary zero, it is fully constructed.  As a result, SAFEPOD
 * objects that are declared as global or static variables are implicitly
 * initialized by the compiler.  Thus, it is never necessary to call the
 * Initialize() or Destroy() methods of a SAFEPOD type.  SAFEPOD objects can
 * be safely used within the global constructor of some other type because
 * they are guaranteed to be initialized even before the global constructors
 * execute.  Note, however, that SAFEPOD objects that are allocated on the
 * stack or heap are not initialized by default.  In these cases, you must
 * call the Initialize() method to initialize them.

/*! \page SYNC_OS OS Template Parameter
 *
 * Most of the synchronization classes are defined as templates with an "OS"
 * template parameter, which provides the basic O/S primitives that each class
 * implementation needs.  The parameter should be the name of a "class" or
 * "struct" type that defines certain static methods (described below).
 *
 * If you are running on a Unix system, you can use one of the pre-defined 
 * "OS" struct's that implement these O/S primitives via the "barecrt" library.
 * For example:
 *
 *                                                                      \code
 *  #include "sync.hpp"
 *  #include "sync/os-barecrt.hpp"
 *
 *  SYNC::SIMPLE_LOCK_SPIN<SYNC::OS_BARECRT> MyLock;
 *                                                                      \endcode
 *
 * You may also define your own type for the "OS" parameter that provides the
 * required O/S primitives.  If you do this, your type must provide static
 * methods that have the same interface as those listed below.  Note that your
 * type need not define all of these methods.  It is only necessary to define
 * the methods that are required for the specific SYNC class that you use.
 * See the documentation of the "OS" parameter in each class for details on
 * this.  Here is an example showing this technique:
 *
 *                                                                      \code
 *  #include "sync.hpp"
 *
 *  struct MY_OS
 *  {
 *      // Yield the processor.
 *      //
 *      static void Yield()
 *      {
 *          // Implementation here
 *      }
 *  };
 *
 *  SYNC::SEMAPHORE_SPIN<MY_OS> MySemaphore;
 *                                                                      \endcode
 *
 * This is a description of all possible "OS" methods and types.  If your
 * custom "OS" struct defines one of these methods, it must match the
 * interface described here.
 *
 *                                                                      \code
 *  struct MY_OS
 *  {
 *      // Methods that can typically be implemented on any O/S.
 *
 *      // A type which represents a time duration.  This should be a class
 *      // or struct that defines the following methods.
 *      //
 *      class TIME_T
 *      {
 *      public:
 *          // Initialize the time to "zero" (no time duration).
 *          //
 *          TIME_T();
 *
 *          // Initialize the time to be a copy of \a other.

 *
 *          // Decrement the time.  The implementation can assume that "this"
