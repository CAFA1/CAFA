 * There are several concrete implementations of SEMAPHORE which all share
 * this interface.  In order to use a SEMAPHORE, you must create an object
 * with one of those concrete impementations (e.g. SEMAPHORE_SPIN).  Some
 * concrete implementations of SEMAPHORE (e.g. POD and SAFEPOD) do not derive
